# Cardano

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company - Cardano

* When was the company incorporated? – 2015 began development and launched in 2017

* Who are the founders of the company? – Charles Hoskinson

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? – Former co-founder of Ethereum and did not like the non-profit direction Ethereum was going, so he left to build his own company and currency that focused on the developing world as a place to store personal information and have trusted transactions.  

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? – Initial coin offering which raised 600 million.


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? – Mission statement is “Cardano is a blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries, with the tools and technologies required to create possibility for the many, as well as the few, and bring about positive global change.”  What is meant by this from watching several interviews that Hoskinson has done, is that he wants to bring legitimacy to the developing world.  Cardano is designed to be able to store information in a reliable place so people are able to have a legitimate identity in the eyes of the government and banks or lending institutions.  This would allow people to have access to proper documentation about themselves and their assets and qualifications, as well as develop credit ratings which would in turn would allow the developing world and its people to create wealth. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? – Currently trying to launch in Africa and Asia (developing nations), but it’s a global company available to all.  The intended African market is said to unlock trillions of dollars of wealth in the long run.
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) – Cardano is a 3rd generation crypto currency that has been able to learn from its predecessors, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and improve upon their limitations.  The proof of stake technology in the Ouroboros design will allow for significantly less energy consumption to approve transactions and to create new blocks on the blockchain.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) – The programming language Cardano uses is Haskell.  They are a blockchain technology which uses Ouroboros proof of stake technology to determine an honest blockchain. The Cardano platform uses Ada as their native currency, which exits on the settlement layer.  This is similar to Bitcoin and tracks the transactions on the blockchain.  The second layer is the computation layer which is similar to Ethereum and is where the smart contracts and applications run on the platform. Cardano's smart contract language is Haskell and it allows developers to run end-to-end tests on their program without leaving the integrated development environment or deploying their code.


## Landscape 

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? – Blockchain and Cryptocurrency 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? – Its brand new.  The first blockchain was Bitcoin in 2009 and then Ethereum in 2013 (launched in 2015) and in the 5 years since then, there have been many new crypto currencies and projects that have stemmed from them.   The major trend and innovation of the industry is the speed and reliability of the blockchain to process transactions.  What Cardano has done to differentiate itself is move from the original proof of work to add new blocks to the blockchain and to verify transactions, to proof of stake to do this.  Ethereum 2.0 is also working on this, and it will significantly reduce the energy needed to operate the blockchain. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Polkadot are some of the largest cryptocurrencies.  

## Results 

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? – So far they are still in their infancy and development stages.  They are working on stage 3 of their 5 stage roadmap. From a business prospective, they have a couple partnerships that have been launched already to begin the process of proving its value.  Cardano has a partnership with the government of Ethiopia to a variety of industries throughout the country as well as to launch a identity and record keeping system for the countries students.  They also have an agreement with the Ministry of Education in Georgia to verify students credentials.  Lastly they partnered with New Balance in 2019 in order to verify the authenticity of the new Kawhi Leonard shoes. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? – They are still relatively new and the entire platform is not yet complete.  That being said, if you look at overall marketcap as a measure of performance they are currently the 4th best currency behind Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance which have the advantage of being first on the scene.  They are ahead, but not by much with more direct competitors in the 3rd generation cryptocurrencies.  


## Recommendations 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) – As it stands right now, I do not have a recommendation on a new product or service that I believe they should offer.  Their goal is already very far reaching and covers a lot of ground and has been intensively researched into the needs of the targeting markets Cardano is trying to break into.  One recommendation I would have though would be to try and partner with more companies, governments or schools in the developed world as well in order to prove Cardano’s effectiveness in its mission.  Adoption from fortune 500 companies, large schools with name recognition and stable, strong governments would be able to showcase the powers of this product to the targeted market in Africa and the developing world and I believe would help to break into these markets more effectively.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? – It would help with adoption of the product in the markets that it is being designed to help.  New and emerging technology is exciting and can cause great change and improvement to how the world operates, but in order for it to be universally accepted, the big and influential powers in the world need to show that they are on board.
